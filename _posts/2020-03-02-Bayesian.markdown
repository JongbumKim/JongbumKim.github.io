## Conditional probability ?

Bayes' theorem is the theoretical underpinning of most of what we do within the Bayesian statistical framework.
Conditional probability is when we're trying to consider two events that are related to each other.
So we can ask, what is the probability of event A given that we know event B happened?
This is defined as the probability that both events A and B happened divided by the probability that event B happens.

$P(A|B) = P(A \cap B)$

For example, consider a class of 30 students.
Suppose within this class, there are 9 female students.
Suppose also, we have 12 computer science majors.
And of which, 4 are female. So then, we can ask questions about probabilities of the segment population.

$P(F) = \frac{9}{30} = \frac{3}{10}$

$P(CS) = \frac{12}{30} = \frac{2}{5}$

$P(F \cap CS) = \frac{4}{30} = \frac{2}{15}$

$P(F|CS) = \frac{P(F \cap CS)}{P(CS)} = \frac{2/15}{2/5} = \frac{1}{3}$

$P(F|CS^{c}) = \frac{P(F \cap CS^{c})}{P(CS^{c})} = \frac{5/30}{18/30} = \frac{5}{12}$
