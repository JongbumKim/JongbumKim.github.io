## Conditional probability ?

Bayes' theorem is the theoretical underpinning of most of what we do within the Bayesian statistical framework.
Conditional probability is when we're trying to consider two events that are related to each other.
So we can ask, what is the probability of event A given that we know event B happened?
This is defined as the probability that both events A and B happened divided by the probability that event B happens.

$P(A \mid B) = P(A \cap B)$

For example, consider a class of 30 students.
Suppose within this class, there are 9 female students.
Suppose also, we have 12 computer science majors.
And of which, 4 are female. So then, we can ask questions about probabilities of the segment population.

$P(F) = \frac{9}{30} = \frac{3}{10}$

$P(CS) = \frac{12}{30} = \frac{2}{5}$

$P(F \cap CS) = \frac{4}{30} = \frac{2}{15}$

$P(F \mid CS) = \frac{P(F \cap CS)}{P(CS)} = \frac{2/15}{2/5} = \frac{1}{3}$

$P(F \mid CS^{c}) = \frac{P(F \cap CS^{c})}{P(CS^{c})} = \frac{5/30}{18/30} = \frac{5}{12}$

--------------------------------
## Independence ?

There's a concept of independence, which is when one event doesn't depend on the other. When two events are independent, we have that the probability of A given B is equal to just the probability of A, it doesn't matter whether, or not B occurred. When this is true, we also get that the probability of A and B happening is just the probability of A times the probability of B. This is a useful equality that we'll use throughout this course.

$P(A \mid B) = P(A)$
then,
$P(A \cap B)=P(A)P(B)$

In this case, we can see that the probability of being a female given they're computer scientist is not equal to the marginal probability that they're female.
And so, being female and being computer science are not independent.

$P(F \mid CS) \neq P(F)$

## Bayes' theorem ?

$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \mid A)P(A) + P(B \mid A^{c})P(A^{c})} = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$

So to work this out in the context of the example of computer science and females in the class.
We can say,
$P(CS \mid F) = \frac{P(F \mid CS)P(CS)}{P(F \mid CS)P(CS) + P(F \mid CS^{c})P(CS^{c})}
              = \frac{(\frac{1}{3})(\frac{2}{5})}{(\frac{1}{3})(\frac{2}{5})+(\frac{5}{18})(\frac{3}{5})=\frac{4}{9}$
$P(CS \mid F) = \frac{P(CS \cap F)}{P(F)} = \frac{4/30}{9/30} = \frac{4}{9}
